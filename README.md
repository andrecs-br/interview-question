## **open-api-spring-boot**

The application can be run using mvn spring-boot:run.

API's documents and their examples are in the swagger that can be accessed by the url http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html

Swagger was generated using the spring-doc openapi model.

For the multiple returns in the participants endpoints, I used the examples to document, as I could not generate multiple 400 errors due to OpenApi specification.
